# Justice-League
A decentralized platform for market research, using collective wisdom to shape the Businesses.


## **Inspiration**

We have witnessed the era of dawn and dusk of the ICOs. Most of the ICO investors doesn’t have technical knack to see the completeness of a project by reading its Whitepaper. And with recent dumps in the market, ICOs have seen an all time low, main reason being trust. “Wisdom of crowd” whereas can change the current lookout. Justice League will change the lookout.


## **What it does?**

It is a decentralized platform for market research, using collective wisdom to shape the Businesses.

## **How we built it?**

## *Tools used-*

Ethereum,Matic Network,Web3.py,Trello

## *Key Languages used-*

Solidity, Python, Flask

</br>

Through the concept of “ wisdom of crowd”, we seamlessly deployed smart contracts to create immutable, scalable and full proof economic JL model. Scaled it using matic network.

## **Challenges we ran into?**

1. Coming up with the JL Model, and the economics was quite tough. 
2. Since we were concerned about scalability, we integrated Matic Network, took time in integration.

## **What we learned?**

While the platform roadmap is sketched out, key partnerships trust is going to be integral for the success of our deployment. Also, time management was key for our webapp. We spent too much time on the first view, which didn't leave much time for the rest, screwing our efficiency.

## **What’s the next move?**

1. Down the road, Building Different Community’s construction.
2. Upgrading JL Model to be more efficient. 

## **How it works?**

A reputed peer with Reputation par “Threshold” tickets a proposal. Anything is fair game, from success of ICO to next Presidential elections.
</br>
Reviewing period of 30 days start. The 2nd Tier Reputed peer ^C, provide with their constructive criticism. </br>
As Reviewing period ends, and Voting period starts. The peers, i.e. general users are provided with 1 “upvote” and 1 “downvote” to consume on the reviews. This maintains the reputation of the reputed peers. </br>
Then Voters select their choice, i.e. if they are positive or negative about this project. And they stake a certain amount on their choice. </br>
Voting lines remain open for 20 days, every peer can only vote once excluding the Reputed peer who pushed the proposal.
As Duration ends, contract report the winning outcome. </br> 
All the peers, who voted for outcome are paid out from the contract according to JL Model.
